# Notifications

Telebugs supports email, push notifications, and webhooks for real-time alerts
on errors.

Configure global settings in your profile > **Notification Configuration**.

Conditions for alerts (apply to all channels):

- New error occurs.
- Error reoccurs after resolution.
- Frequency exceeds threshold (e.g., >10 in 5 minutes).

Projects can disable channels individually. Users can opt out per project in
their profile.

See sub-sections for setup.
