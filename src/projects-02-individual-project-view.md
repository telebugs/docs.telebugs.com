# Individual Project View

Click a project to open its dashboard for analyzing errors.

Key elements:

- Project picker dropdown: Switch projects or access settings.
- Releases link: View release history.
- Search bar: Find errors by message, type, or details (live updates).
- Date range selector: Filter by time (e.g., today, last week) with pager.
- Stats overview: Total reports, new vs. reoccurred.
- Interactive chart: Error volume over time; zoom on spikes.
- Error list: Grouped unique errors with type, message, timestamp, and count. Click for details.
- Filters: All, resolved, unresolved; sort by last seen or count.

If no errors, dashboard shows SDK setup instructions. Refreshes automatically as reports arrive.

Use search and filters to triage high-volume unresolved errors. Chart helps spot deploy or traffic patterns.
