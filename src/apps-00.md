# Apps

Apps group related projects together in the dashboard. This keeps things
organized and makes navigation faster.

The typical setup is one app for your product that contains both backend and
frontend projects. For example, group your Rails project and JavaScript project
under a single "My Blog" app.

App cards appear at the top of the projects dashboard. Each card shows the app
name, project count, and combined recent error activity.

## Managing Apps

- **Create**: Click **New App** on the projects dashboard. Give it a name and
  select the projects to include.
- **Edit**: Open the app or use the three-dot menu on the card. Change the name
  or projects.
- **Pin**: Use the three-dot menu to pin important apps to the top.
- **Delete**: Open the app and click **Delete app**. Confirm the action.

### Key Points

- A project can belong to only one app.
- App names must be unique.
- Deleting an app does not delete projects or errors. Projects simply become
  standalone again.
- Organize however you want. No strict rules.
