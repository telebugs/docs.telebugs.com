# Error Reports

Telebugs collects rich error reports using compatible Sentry SDKs. Each report
contains stack traces, request data, breadcrumbs, tags, and more to help you
diagnose problems quickly.

Similar errors are automatically grouped into issues to reduce noise.

Teams can add notes (with attachments) to discuss and track resolution.

See the following sections for details.
