# Telebugs Philosophy

Telebugs adheres strictly to its guiding principles: **simplicity**,
**security**, and **user control** in error tracking. This directly counters the
pitfalls of modern SaaS tools, where providers lock basic features behind
ever-increasing subscription costs.

At its core, Telebugs is built on a straightforward idea: error tracking should
be simple, secure, and fully under your control. This philosophy influences
every decision—from design and features to deployment—ensuring the tool empowers
developers without unnecessary complexity.

## The Pillars of Telebugs

Telebugs rests on five foundational pillars:

### I: Less is More

Error tracking does not need complex setups or long learning curves. Telebugs
stays minimal on purpose. It is easy to install, easy to use, and easy to
maintain. This approach runs through the whole system.

### II: Be Boring

Telebugs does not try to impress. It just works reliably every day. Good tools
run quietly in the background. You never get excited about running `cd` to
change directories. Telebugs aims for that same quiet reliability.

### III: Own Your Data

Big providers scare you with stories about data loss. They say files vanish
without constant backups and replication. There is some truth to that. But they
blow it out of proportion to keep you locked in. Backups matter, yet they are
not as hard or scary as claimed. You can manage them yourself. No sysadmin
required.

### IV: Freedom to Scale

You do not need Kubernetes for Telebugs, though it works if you want it. Start
with the cheapest [Hetzner][1] VPS. Upgrade the
server as your project grows. Telebugs will not scale forever, but it handles
most indie projects, small teams, and medium businesses through their full
lifecycle.

### V: Finished Software

Telebugs aims to be [finished
software](https://world.hey.com/dhh/finished-software-8ee43637). It ships
complete and stable, without endless new features. Not all tools need constant
growth.

Think about the `cd` command needing a subscription account. That would be
ridiculous. Yet many modern tools end up there. They add more and more features,
needed or not. Then they gate basic access behind paywalls or guest modes.
Telebugs avoids that path. It provides what you need. Nothing more.
