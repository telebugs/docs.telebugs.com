![The Telebugs Manual cover](assets/images/introduction-00/01.svg)

**Telebugs** is a lightweight, self-hosted error tracking system and a seamless
drop-in alternative to Sentry. It collects, groups, and notifies you about
errors in your applications. This helps you fix bugs faster while keeping your
data private and fully under your control.

Telebugs is fully compatible with existing [Sentry SDKs][1]. It works out of the
box with popular languages and frameworks, including JavaScript (React, Vue,
Angular, Svelte, Astro, Solid), Ruby on Rails, Laravel, Django, Go, .NET,
ASP.NET Core, Swift, Spring Boot, and [many more][4].

Unlike cloud-based services with recurring subscriptions and event quotas,
Telebugs is a one-time purchase that you install on your own server:

- No monthly fees or hidden costs
- Unlimited errors, events, projects, and team members
- Complete data ownership and privacy with no third-party processing (perfect
  for GDPR, CCPA, or regulated industries)
- Simple Docker-based setup in about 5 minutes, with automatic SSL and updates
- Focused solely on error tracking: detailed reports, breadcrumbs, notifications
  (email and push), team collaboration with no unnecessary bloat

This manual will guide you through installing Telebugs, setting up projects,
integrating SDKs, and mastering its features to make your software more
reliable.

Let's get started. Your errors won't fix themselves!
