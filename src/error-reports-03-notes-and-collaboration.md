# Notes and Collaboration

Notes let team members comment on an error group, share context, attach files,
and track progress toward resolution.

## Viewing Notes

In the error group page, open the **Notes** section.

Each note shows:

- Author avatar/name and timestamp
- Text content (links are auto-detected)
- Attached files (images as thumbnails, others with icons and download links)

The first attachment on the group becomes the issue's thumbnail in the dashboard list.

## Adding Notes

1. Scroll to **Add a new note** at the bottom.
2. Write your comment.
3. Attach files via **Attach files** or drag-and-drop (multiple supported).
4. Click **Add note**.

Progress is shown for large uploads.

## Managing Notes

- Notes cannot be edited after posting (delete and repost if needed).
- Only the author can delete their own note.
- Admins can purge all attachments project-wide from **Project Settings** >
  **Danger Zone** (irreversible, runs in background).

**Pro tip:** Use notes for reproduction steps, links to PRs or tickets,
screenshots, log files, or "fixed in deploy X" updates.
