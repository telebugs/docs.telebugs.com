# Prerequisites

Telebugs is self-hosted. You need a few things ready before starting.

1. Your own domain name (for example, example.com or telebugs.example.com).
2. A machine connected to the internet.
3. Basic tech skills (you should know how to use SSH and run terminal commands).

> New to self-hosting? No problem. The installer takes care of everything. It
> handles Docker installation, all configuration, and even the TLS certificate.
> You just run one command. Then sit back and have a cup of tea.
