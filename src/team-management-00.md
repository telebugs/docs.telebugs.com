# Team Management

Team management lets you invite collaborators, assign roles, control project
access, and manage notifications.

Start by clicking your profile icon in the top-right and selecting **Team Management**.

## Team Roles

Telebugs uses two roles:

- **Admin**: Full access. Can manage settings, projects, users, and see all
  errors.
- **Member**: Limited access. Can view and resolve errors in assigned projects
  only.

Start new users as members. Promote later as needed.

## Inviting Team Members

Go to **Team Management** > **Members**.

Copy the invite link and share it with trusted people.

The link works for anyone, so keep it private. Regenerate if needed.

## Joining as a Team Member

Click the invite link.

Create an account or log in.

You start with no project access. Ask an admin to assign projects.

## Promoting or Demoting Members

In **Members**, check the box next to a user to make them admin (or uncheck to
demote).

Changes save automatically.

## Removing Team Members

In **Members**, click the remove icon next to the user and confirm.

You can re-invite later if needed.

## Recovering Access

In **Members**, click the user's name.

Copy the recovery link from **Account recovery** and send it to them.

## Project Access

Go to **Team Management** > **Project access**.

Check projects each user can access.

Changes apply immediately.

## Team Notifications

Go to **Team Management** > **Notifications**.

Check projects where users get email alerts.

This is for email only. Other integrations (like Slack) are separate.

## Next Steps

Customize project settings or notifications next.
