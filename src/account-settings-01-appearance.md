# Appearance

The **Appearance** settings allow you to customize the look and feel of the
Telebugs user interface to match your preferences. You can access these settings
by clicking your avatar in the top-right corner and clicking the **Appearance**
button.

**Important:** These settings are global and apply to **all users** on your
Telebugs instance. Changes made here will affect the interface appearance for
everyone.

The dialog provides three independent customization options:

## Width

Controls the maximum width of the main dashboard and content areas.

- **Standard** (default)

  Limits the content width for better readability on larger screens. The
  interface uses comfortable margins on the sides.

- **Wide**

  Expands the dashboard to use the full available width of the browser window.
  Ideal if you prefer seeing more information at once (e.g., longer stack traces
  or wider tables).

## Font

Changes the primary font used throughout the entire Telebugs interface. Telebugs
uses modern system fonts by default for a clean, native look.

- **Default**

  Uses the standard system sans-serif font stack (e.g., -apple-system,
  BlinkMacSystemFont, Segoe UI, Roboto, etc.) for all text in the interface.

- **Monospace**

  Switches the entire interface to use a monospace font globally (e.g., similar
  to Consolas, Menlo, or DejaVu Sans Mono). This applies to all UI text,
  including menus, tables, and dashboards—not just code areas.

## Theme

Controls the color scheme of the entire application.

- **Follow system** (default)

  Automatically switches between light and dark mode based on your operating
  system’s appearance setting.

- **Light**
  Forces the interface to use the light theme regardless of system preference.

- **Dark**
  Forces the interface to use the dark theme regardless of system preference.
