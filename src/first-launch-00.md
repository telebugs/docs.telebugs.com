# First Launch

When you first visit your new Telebugs domain, you land on the setup screen.
Here you create the initial admin account and get started right away.

## Create Your First User

The setup form is straightforward. It asks for:

- **Profile picture** (optional). Shows up across the dashboard and to your teammates.
- **Full name**. Anything you want.
- **Email address**. Does not need to match your purchase email. Use whatever you prefer.
- **Password**. Pick something strong. Telebugs trusts you to choose wisely. No forced rules.

Click **Create your account**. That is it. You are now logged in and ready to use Telebugs.

## Fun Fact

The name field autocompletes with "Grace Hopper" as a small tribute.

[Grace Hopper][1] was a pioneering computer scientist and U.S. Navy rear admiral. In
1947, her team found an actual moth stuck in a relay causing a computer
malfunction. They taped it into the log book and noted they had "debugged" the
machine. This is the origin of the term "bug" in computing.

With Telebugs you carry on the tradition of finding and fixing bugs (without the
physical moths).
