# Pinning Projects

Pin projects to keep them at the top of the dashboard for quick access.

To pin/unpin:

1. Click three dots on the card.
2. Select **Pin project** or **Unpin project**.

Pinned projects show a pin icon and stay at the top, even in apps.

Notes:

- Independent of app pinning.
- Multiple pins allowed; ordered by pin time.

Pin critical or active projects to streamline workflow.
